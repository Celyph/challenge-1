## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I used the ReadMe guide from [https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide).

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
